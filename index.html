                <p class="text-base text-[#4B5563]" style="text-align: justify;">Dio is a tall man with long golden hair and an extremely 
                    muscular build most probably owing to his extensive training during his youth. Following his vampiric transformation he 
                    has been described as attractive by some characters, such as Straizo and much later Enrico Pucci.</p>
               <p class="text-base text-[#4B5563]" style="text-align: justify;">Following DIO's takeover of Jonathan's body, he dons a jacket
                     with a tight black tank top underneath, as well as chaps with an exposed crotch. His face is now in full-view, and on his head is a 
                     heart-shaped circlet to match his knee guards. He also wears pointed shoes known as crackows. This is his form during the 
                     beginning of the DIO's World story arc. In most depictions of DIO, his outfit is tinted orange or yellow.</p>
               <p class="text-base text-[#4B5563]" style="text-align: justify;">He also wears a necklace covering his neck scar and heart motifs above his feet and on his 
                    pant legs, but he quickly stopped sporting them after his first stairway confrontation with Polnareff.</p>
